# Topic Progress Tracker - Progress / Walkthrough

Summary:
Successfully implemented the global topic progress tracking system. Users can now mark topics as "studied" or "completed" through the chat interface, and this progress is synchronized across all interview prep panels.

Key Features Delivered:

1. Global Synchronization:
- Completing a topic in one place (or via chat) marks it as complete across all companies and rounds that share that topic.
- Example: Marking "Arrays and Strings" as complete for Google prep also marks it for Amazon prep.

2. Chat Integration:
- Users can say: "I completed Arrays and Strings" or "I studied Dynamic Programming".
- The AI uses the 'markTopicComplete' tool to update the user's progress.
- Users can ask: "What topics have I finished?" to see a summary.

3. Visual Feedback (PrepDetailPanel):
- Completed topics are now highlighted with a green background and a subtle ring.
- A "✓ Studied [Date]" badge is displayed next to the topic priority.
- Subtopics also inherit a green tint to show they have been covered.

4. Robust Matching:
- Implemented a fuzzy matching system in 'topic-matcher.ts' so that slight variations in topic names (e.g., "Arrays & Strings" vs "Arrays and Strings") are handled correctly.

Testing and Verification:
- Build: ✅ PASSED
- Chat Command: "I completed Arrays and Strings" -> ✅ Success message with date.
- UI Review: Open Kanban card -> ✅ Topic shows green completion badge.
- Global sync: Verified topic shows completed across multiple companies.
