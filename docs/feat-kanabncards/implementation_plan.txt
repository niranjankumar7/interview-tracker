# Topic Progress Tracker - Implementation Plan

Goal Description:
Implement a global topic progress tracker that allows users to mark topics as completed via chat, and have this completion reflected across all relevant interview prep details, including the date of completion.

Proposed Changes:

1. Types Extension (src/types/index.ts)
- Added 'CompletedTopic' interface: { topicName: string, completedAt: string, source: 'chat' | 'manual' }
- This allows tracking when a topic was finished and where it was marked from.

2. Store Updates (src/lib/store.ts)
- Added 'completedTopics' array to state.
- Added 'markTopicComplete' action with normalize logic.
- Added 'unmarkTopicComplete' and 'getTopicCompletion' helpers.
- Uses fuzzy matching to ensure "Arrays & Strings" matches "Arrays and Strings".

3. Tambo Tool for Chat (src/lib/tambo.ts)
- Added 'markTopicComplete' tool for the AI assistant.
- AI can now handle requests like "I've finished studying Dynamic Programming".
- Added 'getCompletedTopics' tool for users to ask "What have I studied so far?".

4. Topic Matching Logic (src/lib/topic-matcher.ts)
- Created a new utility for robust topic name normalization.
- Handles case-insensitivity and special character variations.
- Provides 'getAllPrepTopics' and 'findMatchingTopics' helpers.

5. PrepDetailPanel Update (src/components/prep/PrepDetailPanel.tsx)
- Integrated with global store to check topic completion.
- Added visual '✅ Studied [Date]' badges to topic cards.
- Implemented green styling and ring highlights for completed topics to provide clear visual feedback.

Verification Plan:
- Build verification: Run 'npm run build' to ensure no type errors or syntax issues.
- Functional verification: Use chat to mark a topic as complete and verify the PrepDetailPanel UI updates globally across all relevant cards.
