Dark Mode & Theme Toggle Walkthrough
I have successfully fixed the dark mode issues on the Dashboard and implemented a theme toggle for better user control.

Changes
1. Theme Toggle
Added a new 
ThemeToggle
 component to the top navigation bar. You can now easily switch between Light, Dark, and System themes.

cycled via a sun/moon icon button in the header.
2. Dashboard Dark Mode
The Dashboard page (/dashboard) was previously hardcoded to white. I updated it to use theme-aware colors:

Background adapts to theme (Dark/Light).
Text colors adjust automatically for readability.
Cards and charts now look consistent in both modes.
4. Chat Input Visibility
Fixed an issue where the chat input text was unreadable in dark mode.

Added dark:prose-invert to the text editor to ensure proper typography contrast in dark mode.
5. Sent Message Visibility
Fixed an issue where sent message bubbles were white/invisible in dark mode due to undefined custom classes.

Replaced bg-container and bg-backdrop with standard bg-muted and hover:bg-muted/80.
6. Chat Persistence
Fixed an issue where chat history was lost when navigating between pages (e.g., to Settings and back).

Lifted 
TamboProvider
 to 
src/app/layout.tsx
 to maintain state globally.
Created 
TamboProviderWrapper
 to handle client-side configuration.
Verification Results
Automated Browser Verification
I ran a browser session to verify:

Dashboard Appearance: Confirmed the dashboard is no longer "all-white" in dark mode.
Input Readability: Verified that search bars and chat inputs are readable (light text on dark background).
Toggle Functionality: Confirmed clicking the toggle switches themes instantly.
Chat Input Verification
Typed a test message in Dark Mode.
Verified that the input background is dark and text is light (readable).
Sent Message Verification
Confirmed sent message bubbles are clearly visible in Dark Mode (muted grey background).
Verified text is readable.
Chat Persistence Verification
Confirmed chat messages persist when navigating away from Chat page and returning.
Restoration Verification after Branch Reset
Re-applied all fixes and verified functional state.
Chat Persistence confirmed with "Restoration Test".
Dark Mode visibility confirmed.
Theme Persistence & Toggle Fix
Issue: Theme reverted to stored preference on navigation; Header toggle was unresponsive.
Fix:
Decoupled 
SettingsPage
 from forcing stored theme.
Updated 
ThemeToggle
 to sync changes to store.
Added z-50 to 
ThemeToggle
 to fix unresponsiveness.
Verification: Verified toggling works and persists across 
/chat
 and /settings.
