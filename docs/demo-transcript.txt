DEMO SCRIPT INPUT (must work):
1) User types: “I have an interview at OpenAI next Thursday for SDE”
2) App renders SprintSetupCard with parsed company/date/role
3) User clicks Confirm
4) App shows SprintPlannerView + TodayPlanPanel
5) User types: “Add question: design URL shortener”
6) App renders AddQuestionPanel, user confirms save
7) User types: “What should I do today?”
8) TodayPlanPanel shows tasks and checkbox updates persist


Add “Demo Mode: set today = fixed date”
This ensures the “next Thursday” parsing always behaves the same during judging.
